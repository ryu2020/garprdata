# garprdata
Minor edits to Ben SG's garprdata script with added functions:
* dedicated text files containing players
* the ability to exclude tournaments
* more accessibility to change the region
## usage
* fill in ignore.txt and players.txt, both are fairly self-explanatory
* at the top of the garpr.py script, set the region and ranking window as needed
* run garpr.py
